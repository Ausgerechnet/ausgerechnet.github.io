  abstract =	 {This system description explains how to use several
                  bilingual dictionaries and aligned corpora in order
                  to create translation candidates for novel language
                  pairs. It proposes (1) a graph-based approach which
                  does not depend on cyclical translations and (2) a
                  combination of this method with a collocation-based
                  model using the multilingually aligned Europarl
                  corpus.},
