  abstract =	 {We investigate an approach of improving statistical
                  text classification by combining machine learners
                  with an ontology-based identification of
                  domain-specific topic categories. We apply this
                  approach to ad hoc disclosures by public
                  companies. This form of obligatory publicity
                  concerns all information that might affect the stock
                  price; relevant topic categories are governed by
                  stringent regulations. Our goal is to classify
                  disclosures according to their effect on stock
                  prices (negative, neutral, positive). In the
                  feasibility study reported here, we combine natural
                  language parsing with a formal background ontology
                  to recognize disclosures concerning a particular
                  topic, viz. retirement of key personnel. The
                  semantic analysis identifies such disclosures with
                  high precision and recall. We then demonstrate that
                  machine learners benefit from the additional
                  ontology-based information in different prediction
                  tasks.},
