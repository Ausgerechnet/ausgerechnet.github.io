@article{SchaeferETC2017,
 abstract = {In this article, we present results on the identification and behavioral analysis of social bots in a sample of 542,584 tweets, collected before and after Japan's 2014 General Election. Typical forms of bot activity include massive retweeting and repeated posting of (nearly) the same message, sometimes used in combination. We focus on the second method and present (i) a case study on several patterns of bot activity and (ii) methodological considerations on the automatic identification of such patterns and the prerequisite near-duplicate detection. Moreover, (iii) we give qualitative insights into the purposes behind the usage of social/political bots. We argue that it was in the latency of the semi-public sphere of social media – and not in the visible or manifest public sphere (official campaign platform, mass media) – where Abe's hidden nationalist agenda interlocked and overlapped with the one propagated by organizations such as \emph{Nippon Kaigi} and Internet right-wingers (netto uyo) during the election campaign, the latter potentially forming an enormous online support army of Abe's agenda.},

 abstract = {GeRedE is a 270 million token German CMC corpus containing approximately 380,000 submissions and 6,800,000 comments posted on Reddit between 2010 and 2018. Reddit is a popular online platform combining social news aggregation, discussion and micro-blogging. Starting from a large, freely available data set, the paper describes our approach to filter out German data and further pre-processing steps, as well as which metadata and annotation layers have been included so far. We explore the Reddit sphere, what makes the German data linguistically peculiar, and how some of the communities within Reddit differ from one another. The CWB-indexed version of our final corpus is available via CQPweb, and all our processing scripts as well as all manual annotation and automatic language classification can be downloaded from GitHub.},

 abstract = {The present paper outlines the projected second part of the Corpus Query Lingua Franca (CQLF) family of standards: CQLF Ontology, which is currently in the process of standardization at the International Standards Organization (ISO), in its Technical Committee 37, Subcommittee 4 (TC37SC4) and its national mirrors. The first part of the family, ISO 24623-1 (henceforth CQLF Metamodel), was successfully adopted as an international standard at the beginning of 2018. The present paper reflects the state of the CQLF Ontology at the moment of submission for the Committee Draft ballot. We provide a brief overview of the CQLF Metamodel, present the assumptions and aims of the CQLF Ontology, its basic structure, and its potential extended applications. The full ontology is expected to emerge from a community process, starting from an initial version created by the authors of the present paper.},

@inproceedings{EvertETC2017,
 abstract = {We investigate an approach of improving statistical text classification by combining machine learners with an ontology-based identification of domain-specific topic categories. We apply this approach to ad hoc disclosures by public companies. This form of obligatory publicity concerns all information that might affect the stock price; relevant topic categories are governed by stringent regulations. Our goal is to classify disclosures according to their effect on stock prices (negative, neutral, positive). In the feasibility study reported here, we combine natural language parsing with a formal background ontology to recognize disclosures concerning a particular topic, viz. retirement of key personnel. The semantic analysis identifies such disclosures with high precision and recall. We then demonstrate that machine learners benefit from the additional ontology-based information in different prediction tasks.},
